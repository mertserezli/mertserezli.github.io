The idea here is sorting todo list by value/time(cost) to find most profitable todo items to maximize efficiency. If we always do the most valuable things then we maximize efficiency but in life there are some low value things that we must do like cooking, cleaning, meetings etc. That's why I added a calendar to the app. You can schedule low value things in there to do. In your unscheduled time you can do the high value todos. 

Some of the todos must be done in specific days and times so I added a periodic to do list next to the to do list. I could combine both of these lists but if you have a long list it is hard to track periodic todos in all of your todos. 

In periodic todo list todo items change color when weekday of period is same as today. 

I added a feature called "taskflow" to create a feeling similar to flow state. It starts from most rewarding activity to do, if you don't want to do it you can remove it or schedule it for later. 

You can export and import todos in calendar if your days are similar. (This feature is a bit buggy right now.) 

I will add save and load feature because exporting and importing can be nuisance and I will improve UI, it looks too bad. 

I needed to prioritize and manage my todos. There wasn't a software which does prioritization by value/time criteria with calendar and periodic todos so I had to build this.
