It is a simple app that shows current weather of the city you want.  
  
It gets weather data from  https://openweathermap.org/'s api.  
I followed this tutorial to build it https://youtu.be/GuA0_Z1llYU.  
I used this document to learn about writing tests https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro.  
By creating this app I learned about using third party api's in react, learned using dot env to hide api keys, practiced typescript and learned writing tests for a react app.
