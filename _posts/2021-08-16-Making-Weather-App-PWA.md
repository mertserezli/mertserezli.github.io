title: Making Simple Weather App a PWA
categories: [Project]
---
An update to my simple weather app.  
I added cache and manifest to add pwa feature to it. 
I followed this tutorial: [https://youtu.be/IaJqMcOMuDM](https://youtu.be/IaJqMcOMuDM)   
Apart from the tutorial I had to add "purpose": "any maskable" to the manifest file in order to pass lighthouse's pwa tests.  
It is basically used for prettier icons in mobile devices. https://web.dev/maskable-icon/
