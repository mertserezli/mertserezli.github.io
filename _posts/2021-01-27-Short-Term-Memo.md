Short term memo project aims to memorize things for short term as fast as possible.  
It utilizes [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)  
It respectively uses intervals of 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours and 1 day.   
It stores all information as digital flashcards with front and back face.  
Front face contains question and back face contains the answer for the question.   
If you answer the question right it asks again after next interval. If not it asks again after previous interval.   
If you answer correct after 1 day interval it graduates. You can add it to a longterm spaced repetition program like anki.   
I added export and import cards functions for things you need to know for a short time and need it time to time.  
You can import information you need for a specific situation and memorize them beforehand.  
In the next days I will to improve UI and add sound and image components to the cards.  
With this project I learned about handling dates in firebase, firebase credential management, showing notifications in browser, spaced repetition and react contexts.

## How I use this
I am studying Japanese so currently I am using this to learn kanji. I put 2-3 cards for each kanji I want to learn.  
First one's front side is only kanji itself and backside is onyomi and kunyomi reading of the kanji.  
Second one's front side is a word that contains the kanji and backside is meaning and reading of the word. Third one is optional.  
If it is a kanji that can be used alone then I add a sentence(preferably short) that contains the kanji in frontside and backside is meaning of the sentence.  
After these cards graduate I add them to anki.
